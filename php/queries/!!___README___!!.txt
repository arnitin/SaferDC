In order to avoid redundency the below mentioned file has been edited and appropriate comments added.
Since all 19 files are pretty much similar expect for the actual queries themselves, it doesn't
make sense to type and retype or paste comments again and again.

Please feel free to open "crime_percentage_per_ward_7.php" which is the first file in the list to have a walkthrough
of the code.
